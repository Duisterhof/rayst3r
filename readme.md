# ⚙️ Installation

```bash
mamba create -n rayst3r python=3.11 cmake=3.14.0
mamba activate rayst3r
mamba install pytorch torchvision pytorch-cuda=12.4 -c pytorch -c nvidia # change to your version of cuda
pip install -r requirements.txt

# compile the cuda kernels for RoPE
cd extensions/curope/
python setup.py build_ext --inplace 
cd ../../
```

# 🚀 Usage

The expected input for RaySt3R is a folder with the following structure:

<pre><code>
📁 data_dir/
├── cam2world.pt       # Camera-to-world transformation (PyTorch tensor), 4x4 - eye(4) if not provided
├── depth.png          # Depth image, uint16 with max 10 meters
├── intrinsics.pt      # Camera intrinsics (PyTorch tensor), 3x3 
├── mask.png           # Binary mask image
└── rgb.png            # RGB image
</code></pre>

Note the depth image needs to be saved in uint16, normalized to a 0-10 meters range. We provide an example directory in `example_scene`.
Run RaySt3R with:


```bash
python3 eval_wrapper/eval.py example_scene/
```
This writes a colored point cloud back into the input directory.

Optional flags:
```bash
--visualize # Spins up a rerun client to visualize predictions and camera posees
--run_octmae # Novel views sampled with the OctMAE parameters (see paper)
--set_conf N # Sets confidence threshold to N 
--n_pred_views # Number of predicted views along each axis in a grid, 5--> 22 views total
--filter_all_masks # Use all masks, point gets rejected if in background for a single mask
--tsdf # Fits TSDF to depth maps
```

# 🧪 Gradio app

We also provide a gradio app, which uses <a href="https://wangrc.site/MoGePage/">MoGe</a> and <a href="https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg">Rembg</a> to generate 3D from a single image.

Launch it with:
```bash
python app.py
```

# 🎛️ Parameter Guide

Certain applications may benefit from different hyper parameters, here we provide guidance on how to select them.

#### 🔁 View Sampling

We sample novel views evenly on a cylindrical equal-area projection of the sphere.
Customize sampling in <a href="eval_wrapper/sample_poses.py">sample_poses.py</a>. Use --n_pred_views to reduce the total number of views, making inference faster and reduce overlap and artifacts.

#### 🟢 Confidence Threshold

You can set the confidence threshold with the --set_conf threshold. As shown in the paper, a higher threshold generally improves accuracy, reduces edge bleeding but also affects completeness.

#### 🧼 RaySt3R Masks

On top of what was presented in the paper, we also provide the option to consider all predicted masks for each point. I.e., for any point, if any of the predicted masks classifies them as background the point gets removed.
In our limited testing this led to cleaner predictions, but it ocasinally carves out crucial parts of geometry.

# 🏋️ Training

The RaySt3R training command is provided in <a href="xps/train_rayst3r.py">train_rayst3r.py</a>, documentation will follow later.
